Simple utility which will organize a folder of *.jpg photos renaming them using
a senseable 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc, schema using their creation data as the
sort order.

You'll most likely want to use this for a folder where you drop photos from
different camera sources, i.e. you might go on vacation and use your iPhone for
snapshots and a DLSR for more serious photography. Using this script you can
simply drop everything into a single folder and end up with a stream of photos.

Installation:

  Reqiures Python 2.6+ and the exiftool package:
    MacPorts -> p5-image-exiftool
    Debian   -> libimage-exiftool-perl
